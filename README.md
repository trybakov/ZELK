These two scripts are intened to automate the installation process of the ELK stack and Zeek.

The ELK installlation uses the most recent release (8.6.1) and has basic security enabled by default.

There may be some missing dependencies that must be installed before being able to run the scripts.

The automatic ELK installation should work on all debian based systems, however the Zeek installation will only work on Ubuntu 20.04
